# Tanks-and-Arduino-Controller
Contains a Java application that runs a Tanks game in the Processing IDE. Also contains a C++ Arduino sketch that allows the game to be played using a physical joystick and buttons that are handled by an Arduino Nano. The game concept and implementation was my own creation but was heavily influenced by the style of Wii Tanks.
